After completing the quiz, you are then offered a blank space for you to type your name and save your score onto another page that displays other saved attempts. You have next/previous buttons so you can cycle back through the questions that you may have missed or gotten wrong, any wrong answer will turn the text red and correctly answered questions will turn the text green.
